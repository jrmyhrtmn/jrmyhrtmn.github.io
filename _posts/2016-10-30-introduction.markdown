If you're reading this, I'm going to assume that one of the following is true:

1. You know me and found this link on a social media page (Hi mom!)
2. You're a recruiter that actually followed the link on my resume (Please hire me.)
3. Somehow, against all odds, I became internet famous, and now you, a stranger are reading my thoughts (Why????)
4. You're an archaeologist centuries in the future, reading through the archives of this ancient thing called the internet (Heads up, this isn't very important and you're wasting your time.)

In any case, this is the first entry in what I intend to be a weekly blog. Every Sunday at noon, I plan to upload a new post. The topics of these posts can range from politics to technology, to rants about stupidity, to pretty much any absurd thing that pops in my head. There will be satire, there will be sincerity. There will be completely useless garbage that I'll look back on and regret. This is where I will upload all of the thoughts and rants that come to mind when there is nobody around to share them with.

This blog is still a work in progress. As I am writing this, I am thinking of ways to make the site look better. As I learn more about Jekyll and the tools I am using to build this site, I will continue to update the theme and layout. Consider this website a rolling release, it will never be completed, and updates will be implemented unceremoniously whenever they're finished, bugs and all.

If none of this sounds appealing to you, don't read it. There are plenty of other things to do with your free time. Might I suggest reading a book, running errands, taking an adventure, building an empire, conquering the world, making everyone obey your every--whoops, that's my to-do list. Anyway, thanks for reading this post and please come back for more mildly humorous, potentially frustrating glimpses into the mind of Jeremy Hartman.

Or don't. I'm not the boss of you.
