I know I said I would start posting weekly blogs about what I'm learning, but, after the election, I've been having so many thoughts, and this week I thought I'd do something different instead.

# Shock

Last night, as I was staying up, trying to work on homework, I was distracted by the election results. At first, they seemed normal. No swing states had yet been announced and Trump and Hillary were both winning their respective states. I began to ignore the updates, believing the predictions to be right. Eventually, however, I opened Twitter and realized that things had begun to stray very far from expectations. At this point, I began to panic. I began researching those Canadian colleges I had earlier joked about transferring to. Upon seeing the tuition rate and lack of financial aid for international students, I gave up on my research, clinging to the hope that Hillary could still pull out a victory.

# Denial

I took a shower, calmed down and began to work on my homework again. However, I began to be distracted by the updates streaming to my phone again. However, I continued telling myself that no matter how bleak it looked, things were going to work out. And then Nevada went to Hillary and I was sure of it. I took this as a sign that Hillary would continue to sweep the remaining swing states and pull off the win. Despite great evidence to the contrary, I went to bed that night hoping that Hillary would be president elect when I woke up.

# Anger

I awoke this morning from a dream in which Trump conceded before all the votes were in (true story). I considered asking Google who had won the election before remembering that the Facebook messenger bot that had been updating me the night before would have already sent me the answer (2016, everyone). Upon seeing that it was Trump, I was mad. I couldn't believe that this country I live in had decided to elect this orange, lying, racist, sexist, megalomaniacal, tiny-handed pig in a toupee. I was furious, and only grew more so as I saw people on social media celebrating. I thought of all of the nasty things Trump said during his campaign and felt sick to my stomach with the thought that he would be sitting in the oval office soon enough.

# Bargaining

I went to work this morning somber. I began researching Canadian colleges again. This may have happened, but I did not have to be a part of it. I had voted in two elections now, and not a single person I had voted for had been elected. I picked out three colleges that looked good and were all within driving distance of each other. I began to text my mother about a potential Canadian road trip this winter break. I was growing excited at the prospect of transferring, experiencing a new country and new people. She, however, was quick to remind me of my scholarships and how much more it would cost to change colleges at this point. I began to realize, that as much as I wanted to leave, I was likely going to stay here.

# Depression

It was at this point that I realized this is the darkest timeline. Somewhere out there, there is a country where none of this happened. Everything went according to plan. And then I saw this map:

While I now know this map to be based off of polls, not the actual election, it spawned an idea. There is a timeline where Bernie Sanders won the election. This made realize how many people who had supported Bernie voted for Trump in this election. At first glance, this seems strange, switching from a socialist to a fascist, until you realize what the motivation was: revolution.

# Acceptance

So now here we are, this is how I am coping with the election. I finally understand why some of you voted for Trump. If you voted for Trump because you wanted to build that wall, or to deport all those "illegals", or to ban Muslims from the country, please don't talk to me. You're beyond reasoning. If you voted for Trump because of his policies on abortion, sorry honey, but that ain't happening. Even if Trump could overturn Roe v. Wade, he'd have no reason to, because then he'd lose your vote, wouldn't he? However, if you were fed up with the system and Hillary seemed like more of the same, I get it. If that's why you voted for Trump, I don't hate you. I'm pissed that you helped push race relations back a few decades and gave the media an unending series of scandals to market for the next four years. And under no circumstance would I ever change my vote if given a second chance. I do understand why you did it, though. And since there's no going back to change the outcome and put us on a safer route, let's make the best of what we have.

# Revolution

So what do we have?

*   We have a president that is easy to protest. If we ever run out of scandals, we'll only have to wait a few minutes for a new one.
*   We have an incredibly weak Democratic Party. They control no branches of the federal government, and the people have shown that they don't like the system the party is drawing candidates from.
*   We have a divided Republican Party. Even the last Republican president didn't vote for Trump. It's obvious this party is at war with itself and on the verge of destruction.
*   We have hope that the next election will not be the disaster that this one was.

Now with the parties as weak as they've been since the Civil War, and the government in the control of someone with no political experience, is the perfect time to protest, to start a revolution. We might actually be able to make a change. Let's start getting involved in the local levels, start supporting for third parties. I mean for real, not just voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein because you want to make a point. If we want real change, we have to keep fighting for it, even when there isn't a presidential election. Especially when there isn't a presidential election. Now's our chance. Kill the two party system, because after that election, ironically, we now have to make America great again.

No, it's not the ideal situation, but it's not the darkest timeline. I mean, that election could have plunged the country into a civil war that ended with the firing of all of America's nuclear warheads, ending the world. So, I guess, be thankful for what you've got. And to my friends that happen to be people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ community, Muslims, or anyone else that Trump has threatened, I will be praying and fighting for you. America may have just become a scary place, but that is all the more reason to fight on, because if we don't, if we return to our apathy, I see no way a race between an incumbent Trump and Kanye West is going to be any better than this year.

Come on, America. Don't let me down again.

Please.
