I thought I would take this blog post to talk about what I've been learning lately, both in and out of class. This post is going to serve as an introduction of sorts for a new type of post on this blog. I have decided to start posting another weekly update. These posts will focus entirely on what I have learned in the past week. They will be more of a way for me to keep track of what I've learned than a post aimed at other people. However, I will still try to keep these posts readable for the general public, so anyone can follow along with me as I learn. These posts will be separate from the Sunday post, which will continue to be more random and less specific, if you would rather only read those. So, without further ado, here's what I'm learning currently:

## Classes

These are the classes that I am currently taking in my major at my school.

# Mobile Application Development

In this class, I have been learning how to develop Android applications using Android Studio. This is not one of my favorite classes as it requires the use of an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), something I tend to avoid due to the bloated amount of features, picky auto-formatting, and annoying auto-completion that plague nearly all of them. This class also frustrates me because it only teaches us how to develop for one platform. These annoyances with the class drove me to look for alternatives, which led me to React Native, a Facebook-developed framework for developing cross-platform apps using JavaScript, the same language used on the internet. I'll mention more about this in the personal learning section.

# Data Structures and Algorithms

Quite frankly, this is my favorite class so far. We learn about different ways to think about stored data in computer and how each way of thinking affects the efficiency of different functions performed on the data. We also learn about different algorithms and how efficient they are in different scenarios. This class is teaching me a good deal about optimizing the programs I write.

# Software Engineering I

This is probably my least favorite class ever. For a while, I thought it was because it was boring (It is). However, I have since realized that the main reason I hate this class is not that it is boring, but that it makes my future job look boring. It focuses on the business side of software engineering, often using examples from software engineers building proprietary software for boring companies that build ATMs or something like that, instead of hackers moving the world forward by releasing open-source software that fixes actual people's problems.

# Computer Organization and Architecture

Despite what some of my classmates say, I really like this class. That may just be because I like math, however, because this is pretty much a math class. We learned binary algebra, logic, and how to write in modified assembly language for a simulator of a really old machine. I've learned more about how computers work on a really low level, which has always been something I was fascinated with.

## Self-teaching

This category is for all of the things I am teaching myself in my free time because I want to learn it.

# Python

I am mostly finished with this right now, but I have spent some time learning the Python programming language. I decided to learn this language because of its succinct syntax and focus on saving developers' time instead of runtime. I learned this with a combination of skimming through [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://www.learnpythonthehardway.org) (which is free online and a great place to start if you want to learn computer science) and using it in different competitions.

# JavaScript

I just started learning this language because I want to start building React Native apps next semester and will need this language in order to use it. I have read through some of the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) on Mozilla's developer site, and will be reading through the free [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) on GitHub. I hope to have a basic understanding of this and React Native by January.

# Clojure

This is mostly just a for-fun thing. This language is a Lisp, which means that it is a language with a very unique syntax that (I've heard) changes how you think about programming. It also runs on the Java Virtual Machine, which means that code written in this language can run on every computer with Java installed. I'm learning this by reading [Clojure for the Brave and True](www.braveclojure.com) which, again is available for free online.

# Foreign Languages

I am also learning to speak a few foreign languages using Duolingo (an amazing, free app). I have chosen Spanish, German, and Esperanto. I chose Spanish because it is the second-most common language in America, and is thus the second-most useful language for me to know (the first being English). I chose German because I took it in high school and already know how to speak it a little bit. I chose Esperanto because it is easy to learn and used as a second language by people all over the world, which would make it useful as a way of communicating with more people.

## Conclusion

That's about it, I think. That's what I'm learning right now. You probably noticed that a lot of the things I'm learning on my own are through free methods. This is my favorite thing about the internet, the vast amount of knowledge available for free. This has made it incredibly easy to learn new skills and is something I want to contribute to. If you want to read more about what I'm learning, stay tuned for an announcement about the first of these weekly posts.
